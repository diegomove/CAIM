Let $S$ be the set of the squares. Consider a bijection $f : S \\to [1,pq+pr+qr]$. Firstly, for $1 \\le i \\le p$, let $x_i$ be the sum of all the $q+r$ integers in the $i$-th row of the $(p,q+r)$-rectangle. Secondly, for $1 \\le j \\le q$, let $y_j$ be the sum of all the $p+r$ integers in the $j$-th row of the $(q,p+r)$-rectangle. Finally, for $1\\le k\\le r$, let $z_k$ be the the sum of all the $p+q$ integers in the $k$-th row of the $(r,p+q)$-rectangle. Such an assignment is called a $(p,q,r)$-design if $\\{x_i : 1\\le i\\le p\\}=\\{c_1\\}$ for some constant $c_1$, $\\{y_j : 1\\le j\\le q\\}=\\{c_2\\}$ for some constant $c_2$, and $\\{z_k : 1\\le k\\le r\\}=\\{c_3\\}$ for some constant $c_3$. A $(p,q,r)$-board that admits a $(p,q,r)$-design is called (1) Cartesian magic if $c_1 = c_2 = c_3$ (which is equivalent to supermagic labeling of $K(p,q,r)$); (2) Cartesian bi-magic if $c_1$, $c_2$ and $c_3$ assume exactly 2 distinct values; (3) Cartesian tri-magic if $c_1$, $c_2$ and $c_3$ are all distinct. Thus, Cartesian magicness is a generalization of magic rectangles into 3-dimensional space. In this paper, we study the Cartesian magicness of various $(p,q,r)$-board by matrix approach involving magic squares or rectangles. In Section~2, we obtained sufficient conditions for certain $(p,q,r)$-boards to admit (or not admit) a Cartesian magic design. In particular, it is known that $K(p,p,p)$ is supermagic and thus every $(p,p,p)$-board is Cartesian magic. We gave a short and simpler proof that every $(p,p,p)$-board is Cartesian magic. In Sections~3 and~4, we obtained many necessary and (or) sufficient conditions for various $(p,q,r)$-boards to admit (or not admit) a Cartesion bi-magic and tri-magic design.\n",

Our work is motivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this model, all unitaries belong to the Clifford group. Non-Clifford operations are effected by injecting non-stabiliser states, which are referred to as magic states in this context. Their robustness of magic measures the complexity of simulating the circuit using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm. It is closely related to the degree negativity that slows down Monte Carlo simulations through the infamous sign problem. Surprisingly, the robustness of magic is submultiplicative. This implies that the classical simulation overhead scales subexponentially with the number of injected magic states - better than a naive analysis would suggest. However, determining the robustness of n copies of a magic state is difficult, as its definition involves a convex optimisation problem in a 4^n-dimensional space. In this paper, we make use of inherent symmetries to reduce the problem to n dimensions. The total run-time of our algorithm, while still exponential in n, is super-polynomially faster than previously published methods. We provide a computer implementation and give the robustness of up to 10 copies of the most commonly used magic states. Guided by the exact results, we find an ansatz for approximate solutions that can be evaluated in polynomial time and yield rigorous upper bounds to the robustness. Technically, we use symmetries of the stabiliser polytope to connect the robustness of magic to the geometry of a low-dimensional convex polytope generated by certain signed quantum weight enumerators. As a by-product, we characterised the automorphism group of the stabiliser polytope, and, more generally, of projections onto complex projective 3-designs.\n",

Here, we study a class of related models of $n$-layered graphene with alternating relative twist angle $\\pm \\theta$ which exhibit magic angle flat bands coexisting with several Dirac dispersing bands at the Moir\\'e K point. Remarkably, we find that the Hamiltonian for the multilayer system can be mapped exactly to a set of decoupled bilayers at {\\it different} angles, revealing a remarkable hierarchy mathematically relating all these magic angles to the TBG case. For the trilayer case ($n = 3$), we show that the sequence of magic angle is obtained by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by $\\sqrt{2}$, whereas the quadrilayer case ($n = 4$) has two sequences of magic angles obtained by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by the golden ratio $\\varphi = (\\sqrt{5} + 1)/2 \\approx 1.62$ and its inverse. We also show that for larger $n$, we can tune the angle to obtain several narrow (almost flat) bands simultaneously and that for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, there is a continuum of magic angles for $\\theta \\lesssim 2^o$. Furthermore, we show that tuning several perfectly flat bands for a small number of layers is possible if the coupling between different layers is different. The setup proposed here can be readily achieved by repeatedly applying the \"tear and stack\" method without the need of any extra tuning of the twist angle and has the advantage that the first magic angle is always larger than the bilayer case.\n",

Here, we propose three new ways to quantify the magic of a quantum state using magic monotones, apply the monotones in the characterization of state conversions under stabilizer operations, and connect them with the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We first present a complete theory of these quantifiers for tensor products of single-qubit states, for which the monotones are all equal and all act multiplicatively, constituting the first qubit magic monotones to have this property. We use the monotones to establish several asymptotic and non-asymptotic bounds on state interconversion and distillation rates. We then relate our quantifiers directly to the runtime of classical simulation algorithms, showing that a large amount of magic is a necessary requirement for any quantum speedup. One of our classical simulation algorithms is a quasi-probability simulator with its runtime connected to a generalized notion of negativity, which is exponentially faster than all prior qubit quasi-probability simulation algorithms. We also introduce a new variant of the stabilizer rank simulation algorithm suitable for mixed states, while improving the runtime bounds for this class of simulations. Our work reveals interesting connections between quasi-probability and stabilizer rank simulators, which previously appeared to be unrelated. Generalizing the approach beyond the theory of magic states, we establish methods for the quantitative characterization of classical simulability for more general quantum resources, and use them in the resource theory of quantum coherence to connect the $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence with the simulation of free operations.\n"

So far, very-high-energy (VHE) emission has been observed from this source during either long high states of optical and GeV activity or during short flares. Aims. We search for low-state VHE gamma-ray emission from PKS 1510-089. We aim to characterize and model the source in a broad-band context, which would provide a baseline over which high states and flares could be better understood. Methods. PKS 1510-089 has been monitored by the MAGIC telescopes since 2012. We use daily binned Fermi-LAT flux measurements of PKS 1510-089 to characterize the GeV emission and select the observation periods of MAGIC during low state of activity. For the selected times we compute the average radio, IR, optical, UV, X-ray and gamma-ray emission to construct a low-state spectral energy distribution of the source. The broadband emission is modelled within an External Compton scenario with a stationary emission region through which plasma and magnetic field are flowing. Results. The MAGIC telescopes collected 75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1 GeV was below 3x10 -8 cm -2 s -1 , which is the threshold adopted for the definition of a low gamma-ray activity state. The data show a strongly significant (9.5{\\sigma}) VHE gamma-ray emission at the level of (4.27 +- 0.61 stat ) x 10 -12 cm -2 s -1 above 150 GeV, a factor 80 smaller than the highest flare observed so far from this object. Despite the lower flux, the spectral shape is consistent with earlier detections in the VHE band. The broad-band emission is compatible with the External Compton scenario assuming a large emission region located beyond the broad line region.\n",

The final state with two oppositely charged leptons is considered. The interference contribution to the new physics signal, currently neglected by experimental collaborations in Z'-searches and in the interpretation of the results, can be substantial. It may affect limits or discovery prospects of Z' at the LHC. As the Z'-boson interference is model-dependent, a proper treatment would a priori require a dedicated experimental analysis for each particular model. Doing so could potentially improve the sensitivity to new physics, but would require a much bigger effort from the experimental side. At the same time, it is shown that one can define an invariant mass window, valid for a wide range of models, for which the contribution of the model-dependent interference to the Beyond the Standard Model signal is reduced down to O(10%) level, comparable to the level of the combined uncertainty from parton densities and higher order corrections. This quasi-model independent \"magic cut\" does not scale with the mass of the Z'-boson and is approximately constant over a large range of masses. Such a control of the interference effects relies on not-too-small branching ratios of Z' to leptons which can be suppressed, however, by an additional new decay channels of the Z' increasing the interference effect. Under the general assumption that these new decay chanels of Z' are not dominant, one can perform quasi-model independent analyses, preserving the current scheme used by the experimental collaborations for the Z'-boson search using the suggested invariant mass window cut.\n",

Let $S$ be the set of the squares. Consider a bijection $f : S \\to [1,pq+pr+qr]$. Firstly, for $1 \\le i \\le p$, let $x_i$ be the sum of all the $q+r$ integers in the $i$-th row of the $(p,q+r)$-rectangle. Secondly, for $1 \\le j \\le q$, let $y_j$ be the sum of all the $p+r$ integers in the $j$-th row of the $(q,p+r)$-rectangle. Finally, for $1\\le k\\le r$, let $z_k$ be the the sum of all the $p+q$ integers in the $k$-th row of the $(r,p+q)$-rectangle. Such an assignment is called a $(p,q,r)$-design if $\\{x_i : 1\\le i\\le p\\}=\\{c_1\\}$ for some constant $c_1$, $\\{y_j : 1\\le j\\le q\\}=\\{c_2\\}$ for some constant $c_2$, and $\\{z_k : 1\\le k\\le r\\}=\\{c_3\\}$ for some constant $c_3$. A $(p,q,r)$-board that admits a $(p,q,r)$-design is called (1) Cartesian magic if $c_1 = c_2 = c_3$ (which is equivalent to supermagic labeling of $K(p,q,r)$); (2) Cartesian bi-magic if $c_1$, $c_2$ and $c_3$ assume exactly 2 distinct values; (3) Cartesian tri-magic if $c_1$, $c_2$ and $c_3$ are all distinct. Thus, Cartesian magicness is a generalization of magic rectangles into 3-dimensional space. In this paper, we study the Cartesian magicness of various $(p,q,r)$-board by matrix approach involving magic squares or rectangles. In Section~2, we obtained sufficient conditions for certain $(p,q,r)$-boards to admit (or not admit) a Cartesian magic design. In particular, it is known that $K(p,p,p)$ is supermagic and thus every $(p,p,p)$-board is Cartesian magic. We gave a short and simpler proof that every $(p,p,p)$-board is Cartesian magic. In Sections~3 and~4, we obtained many necessary and (or) sufficient conditions for various $(p,q,r)$-boards to admit (or not admit) a Cartesion bi-magic and tri-magic design.\n",

Our work is motivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this model, all unitaries belong to the Clifford group. Non-Clifford operations are effected by injecting non-stabiliser states, which are referred to as magic states in this context. Their robustness of magic measures the complexity of simulating the circuit using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm. It is closely related to the degree negativity that slows down Monte Carlo simulations through the infamous sign problem. Surprisingly, the robustness of magic is submultiplicative. This implies that the classical simulation overhead scales subexponentially with the number of injected magic states - better than a naive analysis would suggest. However, determining the robustness of n copies of a magic state is difficult, as its definition involves a convex optimisation problem in a 4^n-dimensional space. In this paper, we make use of inherent symmetries to reduce the problem to n dimensions. The total run-time of our algorithm, while still exponential in n, is super-polynomially faster than previously published methods. We provide a computer implementation and give the robustness of up to 10 copies of the most commonly used magic states. Guided by the exact results, we find an ansatz for approximate solutions that can be evaluated in polynomial time and yield rigorous upper bounds to the robustness. Technically, we use symmetries of the stabiliser polytope to connect the robustness of magic to the geometry of a low-dimensional convex polytope generated by certain signed quantum weight enumerators.

Here, we study a class of related models of $n$-layered graphene with alternating relative twist angle $\\pm \\theta$ which exhibit magic angle flat bands coexisting with several Dirac dispersing bands at the Moir\\'e K point. Remarkably, we find that the Hamiltonian for the multilayer system can be mapped exactly to a set of decoupled bilayers at {\\it different} angles, revealing a remarkable hierarchy mathematically relating all these magic angles to the TBG case. For the trilayer case ($n = 3$), we show that the sequence of magic angle is obtained by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by $\\sqrt{2}$, whereas the quadrilayer case ($n = 4$) has two sequences of magic angles obtained by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by the golden ratio $\\varphi = (\\sqrt{5} + 1)/2 \\approx 1.62$ and its inverse. We also show that for larger $n$, we can tune the angle to obtain several narrow (almost flat) bands simultaneously and that for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, there is a continuum of magic angles for $\\theta \\lesssim 2^o$. Furthermore, we show that tuning several perfectly flat bands for a small number of layers is possible if the coupling between different layers is different. The setup proposed here can be readily achieved by repeatedly applying the \"tear and stack\" method without the need of any extra tuning of the twist angle and has the advantage that the first magic angle is always larger than the bilayer case.\n",

Here, we propose three new ways to quantify the magic of a quantum state using magic monotones, apply the monotones in the characterization of state conversions under stabilizer operations, and connect them with the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We first present a complete theory of these quantifiers for tensor products of single-qubit states, for which the monotones are all equal and all act multiplicatively, constituting the first qubit magic monotones to have this property. We use the monotones to establish several asymptotic and non-asymptotic bounds on state interconversion and distillation rates. We then relate our quantifiers directly to the runtime of classical simulation algorithms, showing that a large amount of magic is a necessary requirement for any quantum speedup. One of our classical simulation algorithms is a quasi-probability simulator with its runtime connected to a generalized notion of negativity, which is exponentially faster than all prior qubit quasi-probability simulation algorithms. We also introduce a new variant of the stabilizer rank simulation algorithm suitable for mixed states, while improving the runtime bounds for this class of simulations. Our work reveals interesting connections between quasi-probability and stabilizer rank simulators, which previously appeared to be unrelated. Generalizing the approach beyond the theory of magic states, we establish methods for the quantitative characterization of classical simulability for more general quantum resources, and use them in the resource theory of quantum coherence to connect the $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence with the simulation of free operations.\n",

Current efforts to design large-scale devices require allocating immense resources to error correction, with the majority dedicated to the production of high-fidelity ancillary states known as magic-states. Leading techniques focus on dedicating a large, contiguous region of the processor as a single \"magic-state distillation factory\" responsible for meeting the magic-state demands of applications. In this work we design and analyze a set of optimized factory architectural layouts that divide a single factory into spatially distributed factories located throughout the processor. We find that distributed factory architectures minimize the space-time volume overhead imposed by distillation. Additionally, we find that the number of distributed components in each optimal configuration is sensitive to application characteristics and underlying physical device error rates. More specifically, we find that the rate at which T-gates are demanded by an application has a significant impact on the optimal distillation architecture. We develop an optimization procedure that discovers the optimal number of factory distillation rounds and number of output magic states per factory, as well as an overall system architecture that interacts with the factories. This yields between a 10x and 20x resource reduction compared to commonly accepted single factory designs. Performance is analyzed across representative application classes such as quantum simulation and quantum chemistry.\n"
